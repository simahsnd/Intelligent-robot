### Background

* RaspberryPi 
* Tensorflow
* MobileNet SSD 
* MS COCO 
* IR & Ultrasonic sensors

### Goal

Servo motor powerized robot enhanced with camera to detect objects beside ultrasonic and infrared sensors for line tracking and beware obstacles, programmed by Python and tensorflow machine learning library using a pre-trained quantized MobileNet SSD model trained on the COCO dataset and implemented on Raspberry Pi to control robot remotely via VNC as a remote desktop connection. The robot walks through and avoids obstacles  and classifies seen objects in real-time and grades the prediction possibilities.
